# Minesweeper

This is an AI algorithm that intelligently solves the Minesweeper board.

## Running the tests

```
python minesweeper_ai.py
```
The program shall take the following inputs at each step in the game:
* '$' to input a mine.
* '.' to input a clear cell.
* Some integer from 1-9 to input a clue.

## Run Time

Our program was able to solve in the following time:
* 16 X 16 with 10 mines : 1 second
* 16 X 16 with 20 mines : 1 second
* 16 X 16 with 25 mines : 2 seconds
* 16 X 16 with 30 mines : 20 seconds
* 16 X 16 with 35 mines : 28 seconds
* 16 X 16 with 40 mines : 78 seconds
